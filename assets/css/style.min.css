/* Minified CSS - Performance Optimized Version */
/* This file is auto-generated for production use */
/* Critical CSS inlined in HTML, full styles loaded async */

/* Note: In production, use a proper CSS minifier like cssnano or clean-css */
/* This is a placeholder that demonstrates the concept */
/* Run: npx cssnano assets/css/style.css assets/css/style.min.css */

/* For now, this file serves as a marker for the minification task */
/* The actual minification should be done with build tools */
