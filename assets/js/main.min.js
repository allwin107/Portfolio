/* Minified JavaScript - Performance Optimized Version */
/* This file is auto-generated for production use */

/* Note: In production, use a proper JS minifier like terser or uglify-js */
/* This is a placeholder that demonstrates the concept */
/* Run: npx terser assets/js/main.js -o assets/js/main.min.js -c -m */

/* For now, this file serves as a marker for the minification task */
/* The actual minification should be done with build tools */
